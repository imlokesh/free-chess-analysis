# Free Chess Analysis

This chrome extension will help you analyze your chess.com games on lichess. Just click the icon in your extension bar when you're on a chess.com game and a new lichess tab will open with your game.


## How It Works

- User clicks the extension icon when on a page like `chess.com/game/live/*`
- The extension gets the pgn from chess.com share option.
- The extension creates a new tab with url `lichess.org/paste` and imports your game.
- The extension will automatically turn on local analysis and flip the board if you were black.
